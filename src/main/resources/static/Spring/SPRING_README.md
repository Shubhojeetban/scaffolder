# Spring Boot


## _Introduction_
Spring Boot is an open source Java-based framework used to create a micro Service. It is developed by Pivotal Team and is used to build stand-alone and production ready spring applications. This chapter will give you an introduction to Spring Boot and familiarizes you with its basic concepts.


## _Setup_

### Pre-requisites
- Java installed
- Java IDE installed

### Installation

To install java, refer to : https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp
To install java IDE, refer to: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/kepler/sr2/eclipse-ide-java-developers

You don't need to have Maven and/or Gradle installed. The projects generated by the Spring Initializr come with a Maven Wrapper (command mvnw) or Gradle Wrapper (command gradlew).

After installing the pre-requisites, Feel free to extract the zip file wherever you want on your computer.

### Run
Running your application: ```mvn spring-boot:run```

Now your Spring Boot application starts up. Navigate your web-browser to ```http://localhost:8000/api/hello-world```

Congrats! We have just completed creating a Spring Boot Application and setup our first Controller to return "Hello World!". Welcome to the world of Spring Boot!
