# React


## _Introduction_
React is an open-source JavaScript library for building front end user interfaces. Unlike other JavaScript libraries that provide a full application framework, React is focused solely on creating application views through encapsulated units called components that maintain state and generate UI elements. You can place an individual component on a web page or nest hierarchies of components to create a complex UI.

React components are typically written in JavaScript and JSX (JavaScript XML) which is a JavaScript extension that looks likes a lot like HTML, but has some syntax features that make it easier to do common tasks like registering event handlers for UI elements. A React component implements the render method, which returns the JSX representing the component's UI. In a web app, the JSX code returned by the component is translated into browser-compliant HTML rendered in the browser.


## _Setup_

### Pre-requisites
- Install the latest version of Windows 10 (Version 1903+, Build 18362+) or Windows 11
- Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), including a Linux distribution (like Ubuntu) and make sure it is running in WSL 2 mode. You can check this by opening PowerShell and entering: wsl -l -v
- Install Node.js on WSL 2: These instructions use Node Version Manager (nvm) for installation, you will need a recent version of NodeJS to run create-react-app, as well as a recent version of Node Package Manager (npm). For exact version requirements, see the Create React App website.

### Run

Unzip the zip file you just downloaded.
