# node js


## _Introduction_
Node.js is a run-time environment which includes everything you need to execute a program written in JavaScript. Itâ€™s used for running scripts on the server to render content before it is delivered to a web browser.

NPM stands for Node Package Manager, which is an application and repository for developing and sharing JavaScript code.

## _Setup_

### Pre-requisites
- A user account with administrator privileges (or the ability to download and install software)
- Access to the command line (search > cmd > right-click > run as administrator) OR Windows PowerShell (Search > Powershell > right-click > run as administrator)


### Installation

NPM is the package module which helps javascript developers load dependencies effectively. To load dependencies we just have to run a command in command prompt:

> npm install

This command is finding a json file named as package.json in root directory to install all dependencies defined in the file. For further steps, refer to: https://www.npmjs.com/package/download 

### Run

Unzip the zip file you just downloaded. 

To Run your application using terminal: 
```
node myfirst.js
```

Now your node js application starts up. Navigate your web-browser to ```http://localhost:8000/api/hello-world```
