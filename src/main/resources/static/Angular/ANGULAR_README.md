# Angular


## _Introduction_
Angular is a front-end framework which is used to create web applications. It uses typescript by default for creating logics and methods for a class but the browser doesnâ€™t know typescript. Here webpack comes in picture, webpack is used to compile these typescript files to JavaScript. In addition, there are so many configuration files you will need to run an angular project on your computer.
Angular CLI is a tool that does all these things for you in some simple commands. Angular CLI uses webpack behind to do all this process.
